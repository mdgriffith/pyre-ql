# @pyre/server

Server runtime helpers for executing generated Pyre queries.

Typical usage:

- import generated `queries` map from `pyre/generated/typescript/server`
- execute with `run` from `@pyre/server/query`
- seed fixture data with the generated `seed` helper from `pyre/generated/typescript/server`
- use sync helpers from `@pyre/server/sync` and `@pyre/server/query-sync`

## Seed Data

Generated server output includes a schema-bound `seed` helper for server-side fixtures and imports:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";
import { seed } from "./pyre/generated/typescript/server";

const db = createClient({ url: "file:test.db" });

const result = await seed(db, {
  users: [
    {
      name: "Fred",
      posts: [
        { title: "example post", content: "My content!" },
        { title: "example post2", content: "My content!" },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

Top-level keys are table names. Nested keys must be links declared on the parent table; Pyre derives foreign keys from the link metadata. You can also seed flattened layers by setting foreign key columns directly.

The seed call is atomic: if any row fails validation or insertion, Pyre rolls back the transaction. The returned data contains the full inserted rows, including nested rows.

Seed currently bypasses Pyre query permissions and does not update Pyre sync metadata. Use it for setup/import workflows before synced clients rely on live deltas.

## Install

```bash
bun add @pyre/server
```

## Sync Lifecycle Profiling

Run a local in-memory profile:

```bash
bun run profile:sync
```

Run the same profile against Turso:

```bash
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=libsql://... \
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=... \
SYNC_PROFILE_ALLOW_REMOTE_WRITES=1 \
bun run profile:sync
```

Useful knobs:

- `SYNC_PROFILE_ROWS`, default `1000`
- `SYNC_PROFILE_PAGE_SIZE`, default `1000`
- `SYNC_PROFILE_ITERATIONS`, default `10`
- `SYNC_PROFILE_SESSIONS`, default `25`
- `SYNC_PROFILE_MIMIC_RTT_MS`, default `20`
- `SYNC_PROFILE_MIMIC_BANDWIDTH_MBPS`, default `25`

The profile creates an isolated `pyre_sync_profile_notes` table and reports total time, average time, and percentage by phase for catch-up and mutation-to-delta sync.
It also compares row-materialized catch-up with a SQLite aggregate JSON catch-up shape and prints a simple remote mimic estimate from measured DB payload bytes.
