# @pyre/server

Server runtime helpers for executing generated Pyre queries.

Typical usage:

- import generated `queries` map from `pyre/generated/typescript/server`
- execute with `run` from `@pyre/server/query`
- use sync helpers from `@pyre/server/sync` and `@pyre/server/query-sync`

## Install

```bash
bun add @pyre/server
```
